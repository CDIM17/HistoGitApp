# Histo-Git

This repository houses both the backend and frontend for the Histo-Git project. The backend is built using NestJS, while the frontend is constructed with Angular.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (Recommended v14+)
- npm (comes with Node.js) or Yarn
- Global Angular CLI (for frontend)

## Backend Instructions

### 1. Navigate to the backend directory:

cd histo-git-backend

### 2. Install the dependencies:

npm install

_Or if you prefer using Yarn:_

yarn install

### 3. Set up the environment variables:

Ensure you set up necessary environment variables in a `.env` file based on `.env.example`

### 4. Start the backend server:

npm run start

_Or alternatively, for development mode:_

npm run start:dev

The backend should now be running at `http://localhost:3000` or whichever port you've specified.

## Frontend Instructions

### 1. Navigate to the frontend directory:

cd histo-git-frontend

### 2. Install the dependencies:

npm install

_Or if you prefer using Yarn:_

yarn install

### 3. Start the Angular development server:

ng serve

The frontend should now be accessible at `http://localhost:4200/`.

Voila! You should now have both the frontend and backend running on your local machine.
